# Step runner

When working with mocks, you would have to setup a mock for each command call
with the expected argument numbers, return value, possible output and an index
of the call.  Then, you would run the code to be tested and run assertions for each of the
mocked commands. For large scripts maintaining both parts becomes a tedious task.

This helper allows to setup and process a sequence of string and mocked command
assertions. It helps to make maintenance of complex tests easier.

Consider this example:

```bash
 # Declare STEPS as a global variable, as `process_steps` needs to be called
 # twice and it does not store the steps internally.
 declare -a STEPS=(
   # Mock `drush` binary with an exit status of 1 and no output.
   "@drush -y status --field=drupal-version # 1"
   # Mock `drush` binary with an exit status of 0 and output "success".
   "@drush -y status --fields=bootstrap # success"
   # Mock `drush` binary with an exit status of 1 and output "failure".
   "@drush -y status --fields=bootstrap # 1 # failure"
   # Assert presence of the partial string in the output "Hello world"
   "Hello world"
   # Assert absence of the partial string in the output "Goodbye world"
   "- Goodbye world"
 )

 # Setup phase.
 mocks="$(process_steps "setup")" # $mocks will hold created mocks

 # ... code to be tested ...

 # Assert phase.
 process_steps "assert" "$mocks" # Assertions will be performed.
```

### Step types

A step can be one of the following types:

#### Command
  `@<command> [<args>] # <mock_status> [ # <mock_output> ]`

  Mock the command `<command>` with the given status and optional output.<br/>
  Status can be omitted and `<mock_output>` can be used instead.<br/>
  Steps for the same `@command` can be mocked multiple times.<br/>
  Call to the same command will use the same mock.<br/>

#### Substring presence:

  `<substring>`

  Assert that the output contains the given substring.

#### Substring absence

  `- <substring>`

  Assert that the output does not contain the specified substring.
  Starts with `- ` (minus followed by a space).
